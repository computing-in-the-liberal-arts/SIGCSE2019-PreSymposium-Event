## Institutional and departmental context
- Location: Loudonville, New York, 12211 USA
- Student body size: 3100 students
- Degree(s) offered: B.S. Computer Science, B.S. Software Development
- Department/major name: Computer Science
- Number of contributing faculty: 17 FTE
- Number of majors annually: 30-40 majors

Computer Science has a long history at Siena College.  The Computer
Science Department was created and started offering a B.S. in Computer
Science in 1979.

A second major program in Software Development was approved and first
became available to students in 2018-19.  Its original name was
"Software Engineering", and that what it really is, but the word
"Engineering" is forbidden by New York State Department of Education
rules for schools like Siena which do not have an accredited program
in an engineering discipline.

It is our experience in designing and implementing this Softwate
Development major, and our plans going forward that we wish to present
and discuss.

## Curricular overview

All Siena students are required to complete a Core Curriculum
consisting of 42 credits/14 courses.  These include a 2-course
First-Year Seminar, 8 courses in the Disciplinary Core, and 4 courses
in the Franciscan Concern Core.  Further, a total of 60 credits must
be in courses designated as "liberal arts and science".  As with many
similar schools, these College requirements limit the number of
credits/courses that can be required by majors.

#### College Core Requirements

- CSIS 110 is a breadth-first introduction, offered with several
  themes, and is often taken by students of any major to satisfy the
  college-wide Quantitative Analysis requirement.

- School of Business majors take CSIS courses as part of their requirements.


### Co-curricular program(s)

- Computer Science students are hired to serve as lab assistants and/or to hold evening hours in the public lab as peer tutors.

- Computer Science students are active participants in our outreach
 activities including our annual Project IMPACT (a full day of CS
 activities for local high school students) and our annual High School
 Programming Contest.

- We have an active Computer Science and Women in Computing Clubs who
  organize both internal and external events.  Recently, these have
  included trivia nights at local homeless shelters and hosting a
  Hackathon.

## Key contributions

- Important motivations for the creation of the Software Development
  major included flexibility for students by adding a second major
  option and by requiring fewer specific courses for the Computer
  Science major, and recruiting from among a potential new pool of
  students.

- The Software Development major is very early in its existence, but
  so far it has generated minimal new interest. However, many current
  students have switched back and forth between the two majors.  They
  naturally and conveniently share most early requirements, allowing
  students to choose late in their careers which major to complete.

## Limitations/challenges

Several challenges and opportunities have arisen since the
introduction of the Software Development major:

- As mentioned above, the name change from "Software Engineering" to
  "Software Development" has limited its effectiveness as an
  admissions recruiting tool.

- The Computer Science major lacks a specific capstone experience,
  which previously existed in the form of a two-course Software
  Engineering course.

- Students and academic advisors need to understand both majors.  For
  example, a student who wishes to avoid a specific course required by
  one of the majors (Assembly/Architecture and Theory of Computation
  come to mind) and his/her advisor need to make sure the change is
  consistent with the student's goals after graduation, and need to
  understand the ramifications for making the change on the student's
  ability to graduate on time.

- Upcoming changes to courses in the Business programs will necessitate
  some changes to Software Development requirements.

In response to this, we are considering returning to a single major,
but retaining and expanding the flexibility introduced by the
introduction of Software Development.  The new major is being designed
to include a core of required courses, but with a number of
tracks or concentrations, one of which would need to be completed to
satisfy the major requirements.

We would like to share our thoughts on the new major requirements and
to get advice and feedback from the attendees.
