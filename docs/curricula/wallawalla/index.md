Walla Walla University is a Seventh-day Adventist institution of higher education founded in 1892.  In the 1940s, the university (then college) became the first institution of higher education in the denomination to establish a school of engineering.  This began the tradition of offering STEM majors in the context of a liberal arts education, as is the case with the computer science program.

The computer science department at Walla Walla University grew out of the physics department in the 1980s.  However, after the program came close to closing in 2008. At that time, we were down to only 6 majors all together and university administration reduced our staffing level to 1.33 FTE. After a period of recovery and reorganization, the department began a period of intense curriculum modernization (which was about 20 years overdue) and started growing again in the early 2010's.  As of Fall 2019, we have reached 50 majors and continue to grow.

## Curricular overview

### Major program(s)

The Computer Science major (both B.A. and B.S.) consists of a common core of 38 quarter credits and a senior project sequence of 5 credits.  While designed to be taken one-class a quarter over four years, these classes can be finished in three years by students who transfer to the CS major.  Students in both majors must take the Major Field Test (MFT) in Computer Science, but no particular score is required to graduate.

### Non-major program(s)

**Support Courses:** Several STEM majors require the CPTR 141: *Fundamentals of Programming* course as a cognate.  It must therefore be accessible to those new to programming as well as laying a good foundation for more experienced programmers to go on in the CS curriculum.

**Minor:** The CS minor is 30 credit hours.  Because of prerequisites, it must include CPTR 141/142: *Fundamentals of Programming I and II*.

**Supported Programs:** The School of Engineering offers a BSE degree with a concentration in Computer Engineering.  These students take roughly 9 CPTR courses in addition to their engineering courses and cognates.  Together with the School of Business, we offer a joint degree in Information Systems.  IS students take 30 credits of computer science and 48 credits of business.

### Co-curricular program(s)

We have a student ACM chapter that is currently focusing on making contributions to an open source project.

Alumni from the nearby Seattle area (it's 5 hours away) organize and coach students through a 1.5 day hackathon every spring.

## Key contributions

There are several aspects of Walla Walla University's computer science curriculum of which we are particularly proud.  They include:

- The CPTR 141/142 two-quarter introductory sequence has been the focus of intense development over the last several years.  We have evolved these courses to use [standards-based grading](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational_leadership/oct08/vol66/num02/Seven_Reasons_for_Standards-Based_Grading.aspx), a locally-hosted browser-based development environment based on the [Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) platform, and a mixture of [POGIL](https://cspogil.org/Home) and pairs programming activities that have been locally developed and/or shamelessly stolen from fellow computer science educators.

- The second feature worth mentioning is our gradual introduction of modern software development tools starting in the introductory sequence and culminating in the sophomore year with a new course in software development.  Examples include:
    1. Use of git to distribute and turn in assignments in intro course (CPTR 141) via a provided script (no direct git commands)
    2. Use of git for a group project in second course (CPTR 142), where basic merging is discussed
    3. Required contribution to an open source project in third course (CPTR 108) on github
    4. Full introduction to modern tools (git, linting, continuous integration, etc) in fifth course (CPTR 245)
    
- A focus on career preparedness and service that is spiraled through our curriculum.  Examples include:
    1. Freshmen are introduced to a variety of career paths, required to construct a plan for how they will become *career ready* in the next three years, and required to contribute to an open source project (i.e. engage with a community of developers outside of the university).
    2. Juniors are required to construct a github repository of their work thus far, investigate and at least pretend to apply for internships, engage in community service in the field of computing, and participate in mock code interviews.
    3. Seniors must update their github repository and resume and compute a capstone project for a *real world* client.

## Limitations/challenges

Our curriculum is quite broad given our staffing levels. This presents several challenges:
- We rely on assistance from other deparments (mainly Engineering and Mathematics) to ensure that we can cover all of our courses.
- We expect faculty to be able to teach outside of their area of expertise, which increases the prep load substantially.
- We do not have capacity for a non-majors CS0 style course

We would like to grow the number of students further, but have had challenges connecting with students outside of or traditional feeder schools (denominational secondary schools).  While it is important that we stay true to the Christian worldview of the university, we believe that we are well positioned to serve students from outside of our smaller faith community if we can connect with and recruit them.
