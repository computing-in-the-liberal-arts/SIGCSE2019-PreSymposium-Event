# Benedictine College
Contributed by Donald J. Bagert, dbagert@benedictine.edu

## Institutional and departmental context
- Location: Atchison, Kansas, USA
- Student body size: 1,900
- Degree(s) offered: BA in Computer Science, (new) BS in Computer Science
- Department/major name: Mathematics and Computer Science/Computer Science
- Number of contributing faculty: 2 FTE
- Number of majors annually: About 30

### Contextual Factors:

- From the college mission statement: “…[Benedictine College’s] mission as a Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts, residential college is the education of men and women within a community of faith and scholarship.”   More on the mission, as well as the statements on vision and values for the college, are [here](https://www.benedictine.edu/about/core/index).
- The [Benedictine 2020 strategic plan](https://www.benedictine.edu/about/2020/great-catholic-college) has been to build one of the great Catholic colleges of America.  A new strategic plan is in its last stages of development.
- The college prides itself for being one of only 15 residential colleges that are designated as Programs of Distinction by the Cardinal Newman Society.  (Benedictine is one of only five of those 15 that offer a degree in Computer Science.)
- About half of an undergraduate student’s classes must be used to conform to General Education requirements.  In the case of the two computer science degrees, this means 57 credit hours not already specified by courses required for their respective degrees.
- CS degrees have been awarded at Benedictine for several decades, but the program has traditionally been small, never having had more than 5 students in the senior capstone project at one time until about 7 years ago.  The first time there was ever 2 FTE dedicated just to computer science was 2017-18.

## Curricular overview

### Major program(s)

The CS component of both the BA and the BS programs can be done in three years, allowing the student to start their required CS courses (as well as Discrete Structures I) as late as fall of sophomore year.  This allows those students who are thinking about CS but are not yet sure to take a 3 credit hour “CS0” (breadth-first) course their freshman year before deciding on a major.  (Those that are sure can start with the CS1 course.)
Students in both majors must pass the Major Field Test (MFT) in Computer Science given by Educational Testing Services (ETS) in order to graduate.  Over the last 6 years, more than 95% of CS seniors (all BA majors) have passed the test on their first try.

_Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (BACS)_:  As stated above, the current BACS curriculum was designed be taught with just one FTE faculty member while still providing an acceptable background for an entry-level CS professional.
The BA curriculum breakdown (129 total credit hours):
- Computer Science (32 required hours, no elective hours):
  - Intro to CS I and II (CS1/CS2; in Java) – 4 hours each
  - Discrete Structures II – 3 hours (Discrete I is under math)
  - Database Systems – 4 hours
  - Algorithm Design and Analysis – 4 hours
  - Computer Architecture – 4 hours
  - Operating Systems and Networks – 4 hours
  - Software Engineering (includes capstone project planning) – 3 hours
  - Capstone Project (implementation and delivery) – 2 hours
- Math – 7 hours (Discrete I plus either Statistics or Calculus I)
- General Education courses – 57 hours
- Free electives – 33 hours

There are enough free elective hours to allow a double major of the BACS with almost any other degree at Benedictine.
 
_Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)_:  The BSCS has a traditional computer science curriculum which takes advantage of the program now having two FTE faculty members.  The BS curriculum breakdown (128 credit hours):
- Computer Science (45 hours):
  - 32 CS hours of the BACS
  - Concepts of Programming Languages – 4 hours
  - Theory of Automata – 3 hours
  - 6 hours of CS electives (e.g. artificial intelligence)
- Math – 10 hours (Discrete I, Statistics and Cryptography)
- General Education courses – 57 hours
- Free electives – 16 hours

### Non-major program(s)

Minor: The CS minor is 17 credit hours long and must include the CS1, CS2 and Discrete 1 courses, and at least 6 hours of junior/senior level CS courses.

Certificates: There are no certificate programs at Benedictine College.

Non-major courses: There is a freshman-level web programming course that requires no programming background, a sophomore-level programming course for scientists and engineers that also requires no programming, and a sophomore-level “short course” (only two credit hours) in a particular programming language (e.g. Python or C) which is sometimes taken by non-majors.

## Key contributions
Although a recent development, the new Bachelor of Science program appears to be an important addition to CS at Benedictine.  The CS content of the BS is very close to that of CS2013.  We expect that this will open doors for our graduates to new possibilities in industry, government and graduate school.

At the same time, the already-successful BACS remains successful for those currently pursuing double majors, which include CS with Accounting, Electrical Engineering, Math, Music, Physics, Psychology, Theatre Arts and Theology.

Closed labs are a part of every four-hour CS class and are very successful.  This includes the algorithms and architecture classes, which most CS curricula teach without labs.

Courses whose content which has been fine-tuned in recent years include the CS0 course and the software engineering/capstone project sequence.  The breadth-first CS0 is about 25% programming, and the language used was changed 3 years ago from Alice to Python.  This has helped prospective CS students to have a better idea of what programming in later classes will be like.

Six years ago, the capstone project successfully started using real projects with real clients.  Over that same period, the project process has gone from a waterfall model to agile development, fine-tuning the process for use in an academic environment.

## Limitations/challenges
CS at Benedictine College is a small program in a small school, which makes it difficult in recruiting more students to the CS major.  It also means no more than one section per year for any CS course, which means 6-8 faculty preps each semester.

More access to Apple hardware is needed for labs in some CS courses.
