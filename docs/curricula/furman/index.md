[Furman University](https://www.furman.edu/)'s [mission](https://www.furman.edu/about/mission/statements/) “as a liberal arts institution is to provide a distinctive undergraduate education encompassing humanities, fine arts, social sciences, mathematics and the natural sciences, and selected professional disciplines.” Furman’s signature program, [The Furman Advantage (TFA)](https://www.furman.edu/furman-advantage/), “guarantees every student an unparalleled education that combines classroom learning with real-world experiences and self-discovery. This integrated four-year pathway, guided by a diverse community of mentors, prepares students for lives of purpose and accelerated career and community impact—demonstrating in concrete terms the value of a Furman education.” TFA aims to provide each student with high-impact, engaged learning experiences through mentored research, internships, and study away.

Furman’s curriculum includes 15 general education requirements that can be completed by courses across the university; in other words, for the most part, no one department monopolizes any particular requirement. These include: 2 writing courses (1 Freshman seminar and 1 disciplinary writing course); 11 core requirements including natural science, human behavior, historical analysis, textual analysis, visual and performing arts, mathematical and formal reasoning, foreign language, ultimate (i.e., metaphysical, ethical, religious) questions, and mind and body; and 2 global awareness courses. Furman students also complete one (or more) major(s). The University does not have traditional minors, but offers interdisciplinary minors that integrate 3 or more disciplines.

Computer Science at Furman was founded in 1967. Our enrollments tend to track national enrollment trends. As a department, we embrace a liberal arts education with interdisciplinary endeavors. We seek to develop courses and programs of value to both students majoring in computer science as well as those in other majors.

## Curricular overview

### Major program(s)

We offer a [BS in Computer Science](https://www.furman.edu/academics/computer-science/program-overview/computer-science/), which follows a traditional curriculum, and an interdisciplinary BA and BS in Information Technology (see [1] for motivation and discussion). The BA and BS differ with respect to the Math and Science requirements, as prescribed by Furman general education requirements for a BS.

Computer Science does not currently participate in any of Furman’s interdisciplinary minor programs, though we are brainstorming and developing several ideas, such as Computational Science, Data Science, and Human-Centered Design.

#### [BS Computer Science](https://www.furman.edu/academics/computer-science/program-overview/computer-science/)
- CSC-105 Intro to Computer Science
- CSC-121 Intro to Computer Programming
- CSC-122 Data Structures and Algorithms
- CSC-231 Computer Organization
- CSC-261 Discrete Structures for Computer Science
- CSC-361 Information Structures
- CSC-461 Computational Theory
- MTH-150 Analytic Geometry and Calculus I
- CSC-475 Seminar in Computer Science OR CSC-502 Research (i.e., Thesis)
- One additional foundational mathematics course (Statistics, Calculus II, or Vectors & Matrices)
- Three 300-level electives (one of which can be a mathematics course)

#### [BA or BS Information Technology]( https://www.furman.edu/academics/computer-science/program-overview/information-technology-ba/)
- CSC-105 Intro to Computer Science
- CSC-121 Intro to Computer Programming
- CSC-122 Data Structures and Algorithms
- CSC-475 Seminar in Computer Science OR CSC-502 Research (i.e., Thesis)
- Two CSC electives numbered 200 or greater with at least one numbered 300 or greater
- Three other courses numbered 200 or greater in a “cognate discipline” with at least one numbered 300 or greater

The cognate discipline may include any courses leading to an award of a major in another field of study. Students work with faculty to select courses comprising a consistent theme. The capstone (CSC-475 or CSC-502) integrates the interdisciplinary theme.

#### [BS Information Technology]( https://www.furman.edu/academics/computer-science/program-overview/information-technology-bs/)

In addition to the requirements for a BA in Information Technology, students must complete:
- MTH-120 Introduction to Statistics AND MTH-145 Calculus for Management, Life and Social Sciences

OR

- MTH-150 Analytic Geometry and Calculus I

### Non-major program(s)

__Freshman Seminars:__ Computer Science faculty enthusiastically participate in Furman’s Freshman Seminar Program with courses such as “Design Thinking and Writing,” “The Cult of Apple,” “Our Technological Heritage,” and “Turing: Thinking Machines, Codes, and Other Enigmas” [2, 3].

__General Education Requirements:__ Our CSC-105, Introduction to Computer Science, a thematic, breadth-based course designed as a gateway to the major as well as for non-majors [5, 6], and CSC-121, Introduction to Computer Programming, grant “Mathematics and Formal Reasoning” credit under Furman’s general education requirements. In addition, we are developing a series of 200-level courses that fulfill general education requirements other than Mathematics and Formal Reasoning and require at most CSC-105 as a prerequisite [7]. Existing courses include: “Introduction to Data Mining” for “Human Behavior” credit and “History of Technology and Discovery” for “Historical Analysis” credit.

### Co-curricular program(s)

__Research Experiences:__ In line with TFA initiatives to provide Furman students with high-impact educational experiences, Furman Computer Science has a thriving undergraduate research program, with students working with faculty on original research. Many of our research projects are interdisciplinary, and involve faculty and students across campus. Much of this research takes place as part of Furman’s summer research program, though research is ongoing throughout the year. Student-faculty research is presented at regional and international conferences, and published in undergraduate and professional venues. Several students have won undergraduate research competitions.

__Computing in Community:__ Furman Computer Science promotes computer science as a community-engaged liberal arts discipline through our Computing in Community Program. This program funds internships, interdisciplinary student-faculty research collaborations, and a senior award. Our future plans include building a community of faculty across disciplines using computing in their research and teaching, and supporting these faculty in developing course modules, co-taught classes, and research projects through funding and workshops.

__Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC):__ In recent years, we have sent any student who applied to GHC. However, current registration limitations at the conference have prevented this.

__ACM Student Group:__ Our ACM student group hosts activities for student-faculty informal interactions throughout the term (on average every 2-3 weeks). We believe these activities contribute to the diversity and belonging we are observing in our students.

__Programming Competitions and Hack-a-thons:__ We send students to programming competitions and hack-a-thons.

## Key contributions

Our unique contributions include our Information Technology major as well as the non-major and co-curricular programs described above. See our references for articles that support adoption/adaption by others.

## Limitations/challenges

Though current enrollments are strong, for many Furman students, computer science is still not “on their radar.” We are continually looking for innovative ways to reach a broader student audience and foster the interdisciplinary nature of computer science. In doing so, we must consider that between Furman’s general education requirements, and the desire of many students for “credentials” in the form of multiple majors and minors, that a lot students are taking few, if any, true electives, i.e., course that do not “count” for something.
