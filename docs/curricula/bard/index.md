# Bard College
Contributed by Keith O'Hara, <kohara@bard.edu>

## Institutional and departmental context
- Location: Annandale-on-Hudson, NY
- Student body size: 2,000 students
- Degree(s) offered: B.A.
- Department/major name: Computer Science
- Number of contributing faculty: 4 FTE
- Number of majors annually: 20 seniors this year (largest year ever)

Our program started in 2000 and is located in the Division of Science,
Mathematics and Computing. Every Bard student completes a year-long
senior project in their program of study. Some students do two majors
and thus two senior projects, others combine their programs into a
joint senior project. Our program is highly interdisciplinary with
connections to programs in all four of the college's divisions, but we
have particularly strong links with the Mathematics and Biology
Programs, and two concentrations (interdisciplinary minors, although
Bard does not offer minors): Mind, Brain & Behavior and Experimental
Humanities.

## Curricular overview

At Bard we have a process called *moderation* when students officially
select a program of study, typically during the second year. A
moderating student writes and presents two college-wide standard
papers reflecting on past and future academic work, and in our
program, a project, to a board of three faculty members.

Students typically take four classes a semester; each class is worth
four credits. Some of our courses have a lab component, marked with
a + below, but are still four credits for the student.

### Major program(s)

#### Pre-Moderation (first two years)

- Object-Oriented Programming+ (CMSC 141 [Processing] or 143 [Python])
- Calculus I (Math 141)
- Discrete Mathematics (CMSC 145)
- Data Structures+ (CMSC 201)

#### Post-Moderation (first two years)

- Statistics for Computing (CMSC 275 or BioStats, Psych Stats,
  Econometrics)
- Algorithms (CMSC 301)
- Design of Programming Languages+ (CMSC 305)
- Systems Course+
  - options: Computer Architecture (225) Principles of Computing
    Systems (226), Multiprocessor Architecture (325), Operating
    Systems (326), Computer Networks (335)
- Two or more CMSC electives, at least one numbered 300 or above:
  - recent options: Artificial Intelligence, Automated Deduction
    Bioinformatics, The Computational Image, Databases+, Discrete &
    Computational Geometry, Intelligent Robotics and Perception,
    Machine Learning, Mobile Applications, Programming Nature,
    Scientific Computing, Topics in Music Software
- Senior Project (two semesters)

### Non-major program(s)

- Variety of "Introduction to Computing" courses taught in a
  programming context.  Satisfies college-wide Math & Computing
  distribution requirement.

  - Robotics (113)
  - Simulating Reality (115)
  - Web Informatics (116)
  - Interactive Systems (117)
  - Hapax Legomena and the Words We Use: Computing for the Digital Humanities (118)
  - (De-)Coding the Drone (119)
  - Technologies of Reading: Human and Machine Approaches to Literature (120)
  - Foundations of Mind, Brain and Behavior (131)
  - Games at Work: Procedures, Participation and Play (135)
  
### Co-curricular program(s)

- CS students are hired to act as dedicated course tutors for
  lower-college courses; they attend the lab with the instructor and
  hold out-of-class office hours. Other students tutor on campus and
  in the Bard Prison Initiative.
  
- CS students serve as the instructors for our "Linking Language and
  Thinking with Code" program the past four years (see below).

- Student projects/clubs include a tech education effort at a Haitian
  community art center; Girls who Code program in a local high school;
  a robotics club; participation in maker faires and hackathons.

## Key contributions

- Our curriculum is flexible allowing for late starts and
  interdisciplinary courses of study.
  
- For the last five years we have been offering a coding-as-writing
  component in our Language and Thinking Program (L&T). All 500 first
  year students arrive to campus three weeks before their first
  semester and participate in L&T, a writing intensive introduction
  to the liberal arts. We have been using Twine the last few
  years. <https://code.languageandthinking.bard.edu/>

## Limitations/challenges

- Like many other colleges, finding faculty (tenure-track, visiting
  and adjuncts) has been a challenge.
- Large diversity in the kinds of senior projects (science, math, art,
  software development)
- Supporting service courses (non-majors) in an era of rapid growth
