## Description

Most liberal arts colleges are facing CS enrollments that exceed what the faculty can properly serve.  Stretching our faculty resources thinner and thinner is not an acceptable response.  On the other hand, all of our schools are committed to educating diverse student populations. We have all worked hard to convince women and underrepresented minorities that they belong in our CS classes.  Freezing enrollment limits tends to freeze out the students who aren’t assertive about taking our classes, and this group is dominated by students who aren’t sure they belong. Is there a way to hold the line on enrollments while still expanding access to non-traditional groups?
