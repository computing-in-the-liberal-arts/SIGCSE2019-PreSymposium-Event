## Description

Hiring and retaining faculty in academic computer science programs is a challenge at all institutions and perhaps particularly at liberal arts institutions. Graduate students may not understand the nature of these positions; for example, they may not know what a liberal arts philosophy entails, that active research takes place at liberal arts institutions, and that teaching loads can vary. This discussion will focus on collecting ideas for how to communicate about the advantages of academic positions at liberal arts institutions and opportunities for collaboration to distribute this information to candidates on or about to enter the job market.
