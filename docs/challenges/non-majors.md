## Description

It used to be very common in CS to have specific non-major courses, often with little or no programming content.   (_DeMystifying the Internet_ was the name of one of ours.)  There were always issues with them:
 - Did they deflect good students from the “real” intro course?
 - What should be in them?  

It seems to be less common to have such courses now -
there are easier programming environments - Python, Snap/Scratch; everyone “should” learn to code; we have so many majors that we don’t have the staff for such courses, etc.  But the fundamental question remains:
 - What are the interesting options for teaching non-majors?  
 - Should they learn to code?  
 - Should they learn data mining?  
 - Should they learn what a Turing machine is?
 - Should the non-majors course follow the intro course, rather than being a substitute for it?  

I hope that people will have ideas to share.
