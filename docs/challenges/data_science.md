## Description

With the continued growth of Data Science as a discipline there is a new, though similar,
issue of serving a wide-range of students, both majors and non-majors. Specifically, a new
challenge has been given to computer science departments to serve ‘almost’ majors. Beyond simply a
“non-major” data science majors need a significant amount of computing courses yet may not (or
may) plan to fully major in computer science. Moreover, the needs of a data science student, while
more like a computer science major than other non-majors, still differ from a traditional computer
scientist.

This discussion will spend time thinking about what is different, and the same, in terms of
teaching data science majors along-side computer science majors. If your school can offer multiple
sections, where should they go (the major’s course? The non-major’s course?). If your school offers a
data-science degree, but NOT in the computer science department, how strongly should you be
advocating for involvement? Should Computer Science departments be offering “Introductory Data
Science” courses? As an upper-level elective? For all students? What are some of the concerns in
terms of relating with Mathematics or Statistics Departments?
